### 🔹 Variables and Assignments
Learn how to create, overwrite, and name variables effectively.

```python
name = "Alice"  # Assigning
name = "Bob"    # Overwriting
user_age = 25   # Good naming practice
```

### 🔹 Deleting Variables
Understand how to delete variables using the `del` keyword.

```python
price = 5
del price
```

### 🔹 Type Conversion
Convert between data types such as `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.

```python
num_str = "50"
num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts string to integer
```

### 🔹 Arithmetic & Comparison Operators

Master operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and comparisons like `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`.

```python
a = 10
b = 3
result = a / b      # Division
comparison = a > b  # Returns True
```

### 🔹 String Indexing & Slicing
Extract parts of a string using indices and slicing.

```python
name = "DataScience"
print(name[0])       # Output: D
print(name[0:4])     # Output: Data
```

### 🔹 String Methods
Explore common string methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `title()`, `replace()`, etc.

```python
msg = "welcome"
print(msg.upper())   # Output: WELCOME
```

### 🔹 F-Strings (Formatted Strings)
Learn how to format strings using Python 3.6+ f-strings.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 24
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```
