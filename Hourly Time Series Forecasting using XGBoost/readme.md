## 🛠 Step-by-Step Work Process
### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
✔ Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
✔ Created time-based features: Hour, Day of Week, Month, Year, etc.
✔ Split the dataset into training (before 2015) and testing (after 2015).
✔ Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.

### 2️⃣ **Modeling with XGBoost**
✔ Implemented XGBoost for time series forecasting.
✔ Trained the model on historical data.
✔ Evaluated feature importance (Day of Year, Hour, and Year most significant).
✔ Generated predictions for unseen data.

### 3️⃣ **Performance Evaluation**
✔ **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 2,603,992.46  
✔ **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 1,237.15  
✔ **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** 8.26%  
✔ Analyzed best/worst predicted days.

### 4️⃣ **Insights from Forecast Errors**
✔ Model struggles with holidays (July 4th, Christmas, etc.).
✔ Over-forecasting on special days with abnormal consumption patterns.
✔ Need for additional external factors like weather data.
