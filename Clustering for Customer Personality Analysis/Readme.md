## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Clean data and handle missing values.
   - Perform outlier treatment (capping, winsorization).
   - Apply log transformation and categorical encoding.
   - Standardize numerical features using Z-score normalization.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering**  
   - Implement **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for feature reduction.
   - Utilize **K-Means Clustering** for larger datasets.
   - Use **Agglomerative Clustering** for hierarchical insights.
   
3. **Cluster Profiling & Business Insights**  
   - Identify key customer groups based on demographics & spending habits.
   - Analyze clusters for strategic marketing decisions.
